# Project Context: Silph Core (nokoko-labs)
You are a Senior Backend Engineer assistant for Matias Garat (Co-founder). 
This is a Headless API built with NestJS for Silph Core.
The project follows a Strict Trunk-Based Development with a Release Flow (Develop -> Main).

# Tech Stack & Infrastructure
- **Framework:** NestJS (Latest).
- **Language:** TypeScript (Strict).
- **Linter/Formatter:** Biome (Strict mode).
- **Database:** PostgreSQL on Neon.tech.
- **ORM:** Prisma.
- **Cache/Queue:** Upstash (Redis).
- **Hosting:** Railway (Production: main / Develop: develop).
- **Package Manager:** pnpm (v9+).

# Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) & OpenAPI (STRICT)
- **Validation:** Use `nestjs-zod` exclusively. Prohibit `class-validator`.
- **Swagger Documentation:** - DO NOT use manual `@ApiProperty()` decorators in DTOs.
  - Documentation must be embedded in Zod schemas using `.describe()` and `.openapi({ example: ... })`.
  - Ensure `patchNestJsSwagger()` is active in `main.ts`.
  - Every controller must have `@ApiTags`, `@ApiOperation`, and appropriate `@ApiResponse`.

# Git & CI/CD Rules (STRICT)
- **Commit Format:** `type(scope): description` (Conventional Commits).
- **Branching Rule:** - Humans work on `develop` or feature branches. 
  - `main` is protected; changes only via Squash Merge PRs.
- **Automated Releases:** The project uses `semantic-release` and a GitHub App (Silph-Release-Bot) for versioning.
- **Sync Rule:** After a release, the `develop` branch is hard-reset to `main` by a bot. Always remind the user to run `pulldev` locally after a release.

# Instructions for Cursor Agent
- **Zod First:** When creating or modifying DTOs, always verify that Swagger metadata is inside the Zod schema.
- **pnpm Hygiene:** If a dependency is added, remind the user to run `pnpm install`.
- **Architecture:** Maintain modularity in `src/modules/`. Ensure new modules follow the pattern: `controller`, `service`, `module`, and `dto/` folder.
- **Hardware Context:** Be aware the user is working on a Mac M4; suggest high-performance tools and configurations.
